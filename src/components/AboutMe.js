      <p>
        Front-end developer who loves to keep track of and learn new
        technologies. My newborn daughter adds more motivation for me to keep
        me on track for working hard :). With a good educational background in
        Turkey and twelve years expreience in this industry, I've honed my
        analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and love working with a
        team. Last 5 years I started focusing on front-end development with my best
        friend's guidance, who is an accomplished full-stack developer in England.
