      <p>
        Front-end developer who loves to keep tracking and learning new
        technologies. My newborn daughter who adds more motivation to me to keep
        me on track for working hard :). With a good educational background in
        Turkey and twelve years expreience in this industry, I've honed my
        analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and love working with a
        team. Last 5 years I started focus on front-end development with my best
        friend guidance, who heâ€™s a master full-stack developer in England.
